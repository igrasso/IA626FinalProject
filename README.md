## Motivation

There are over 500,000 Floridians who are eligible for SNAP benefits but do not use them. A random sample of Floridians receiving SNAP benefits where information on ethnicity, county, age, household size, employment status, primary language, education, and gender was collected is explored and compared to trends in the Florida general population. The overarching goal is to understand why eligible Floridians are not taking advantage of these benefits, as well as identify if there are any populations in particular that are underrepresented. 

## Racial Distribution Among Florida SNAP Recipients

Answers of “white,” “caucasion,” “Hispanic-white,” and “caucasian” were all categorized as “White.” Answers of “black,” “Hispanic-black,” and “African American” were categorized as “Black/African American”. “Asian” and “asian” were categorized as “Asian.” “Native American” and “Native American and Native Alaskan” were categorized as “Native American/Native Alaskan.” Assumptions were made to match the categories provided in US census data https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/florida/demographic-statistics
