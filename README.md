## Motivation

There are over 500,000 Floridians who are eligible for SNAP benefits but do not use them. A random sample of Floridians receiving SNAP benefits where information on ethnicity, county, age, household size, employment status, primary language, education, and gender was collected is explored and compared to trends in the Florida general population. The overarching goal is to understand why eligible Floridians are not taking advantage of these benefits, as well as identify if there are any populations in particular that are underrepresented.
